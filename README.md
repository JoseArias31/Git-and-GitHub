# Git

*After Installing Git, let's learn some git concepts.

-Git Bash: It's the tools that will operate any commands with the file localy.

It easy to open, just go to windows search and type Git Bush.

Commands:

-cd: Change Directory
if a text has many spaces in between, instead of typing: cd Folder to Create a new project. we should try with "": "Folder to Create a new project" 
-cd ..: This command is useful to go back to the previous folder.
-cd: This command is to go to to the main root location

If I want to create a new folder:
-mkdir: Make Directory = mkdir new folder
-ls: I can use this command to see what files are in the current file.
-rmdir: remove Directory
